* ADTs & the Domain Model

This ticket is orthogonal to the question of how our domain model handles validation errors at runtime

Option<loading
  TaskEither<
    FetchError,
    Either<
      ValidationError,
      ComponentData>>>

Our domain model is a disjoint union with an initial cardinality of 4:

type Model = Loading | FetchError | ValidationError | Success
import { onLoading, onFetchError, onValidationError, onSuccess } from 'elsewhere'

//App would looks like this?

const App = () => pipe(
  appState,
  0ption.fold(onLoading),
  TaskEither().fold(
    onFetchError, Either.chain(
      onValidationError, onSuccess))
