* React

- Use ADTs for modeling props/state
  - Sum types (tagged unions) can simplify React patterns that are often taken for granted
    - For example, every time we add a boolean to a component's model, we double the component's "possible" states; even Apollo Client is guilty of using `loading`, `success` and `error` values in an interface, when a type might be more appropriate

      #+BEGIN_SRC typescript
import { Option } from 'fp-ts/lib/Option'
import { Either } from 'fp-ts/lib/Either'

type AsyncResource<Err, Data> = Option<Either<Err, Data>>

      #+END_SRC

- Use narrower types; not sure how to enforce this except to dig into early PRs and ask/teach
   
  *Examples:*

  * [X] REA: `ReadOnlyArray` should be the default since it is more explicit and gives us immutability at compile time for free
  * [ ] +const assertions+: [[https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions][const assertions]] on props to enforce readonly properties, prevent widening?
    + Looks like const assertions aren't immediately fully immutable
    #+BEGIN_SRC typescript



    #+END_SRC

- Make escape hatches explicit upfront

  Possible examples:
  - Add a namespaced / dunderscored prop to globals like ~window~ or ~global~ for debugging in browser/ssr, for example



- CSS
  - [ ] styled-components
  - [ ] tailwind
