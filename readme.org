* Goals

1. [Short-term] Ship new goals on time, without incurring unnecessary technical debt
2. [Mid-term] Simplify how Kazoo creates and maintains data visualizations
   - *Benefit:* Less time to market generally
   - *Benefit:* Decreases engineering's dependence on Insights team for small changes
3. [Long-term] Architectural flexibility
4. Have fun
     

* The case for killing GoodData UI

1. They do one thing well, and it's not writing React component libraries
2. Maintaining GoodData UI library is not a direct source of revenue
   - Unmaintained
   - Interests are not aligned; updates seem designed to increase the stickiness of their product, not the stickiness of our product
   - They close tickets without explanation
   - Documentation is an after-thought
3. Bundle üëÄ
   - Run [[http://127.0.0.1:8888/][yarn profile:frontend bundle]] in KazooWeb
   - 

* Alternatives

1. Every data-viz libary I found has d3 in their dependency tree somewhere
   - Most open-source libraries just wrap d3 & tailor it for a specific use-case (none is just right, all have tradeoffs)
     - By extension, _every library_ comes with a significant tradeoff
       
** Library comparison
       
| LIB          | PROS                             | CONS                               |
|--------------+----------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| =Recharts=   | Declarative API                  | O(n^2), Œ∏(log(n)), ‚Ñ¶(n) ***        |
|              | Maintained & Popular             | Blackbox interface                 |
| =Highcharts= | Looks sleek                      | Too many features, hard to opt out |
| =Victory=    | Customizable, easy to use        | Opinionated                        |
|              | Dogfooding (company uses it)     | React-Native focus                 |
| =GoodData=   | Dashboard iframes out of the box | <BadComponents />                  |
|              |                                  | Package bloat                      |
| =Nivo=       | Awesome interactivity            | Hard to control animations         |
|              | /Beautiful/                      | More for prototyping / exploration |
       

* d3 ü§î

1. Leverage CDNs / user caches (d3 has the largest marketshare by far)
2. Ships ES6 modules (üå¥shaking)


* Things to think about

1. Might need to write a thin client for GoodData's REST api to avoid using <Execute /> (or write a parser?)
2. Unsure how long we'd have to live with having d3 and G
3. Where will data be coming from? Stay in GD for now?
